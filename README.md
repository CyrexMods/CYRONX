# CYRONX
CYRONX mod for Hypixel. 

INSTRUCTIONS: Download forge 1.8.9 (modloader) if you haven't done it yet. After you downloaded forge, download the mod, put it in your mods folder (%appdata%/.minecraft/mods), then start the game! Join Hypixel.net, then head to your island.  There, create a chest and put the item you want to dupe in it. Then, you will see the button (on the right side) which says: "dupe start". Press it, the server will crash itself and load a backup, then rejoin the server, open the chest once again, and you will see 2 items (previously only 1 item) in the chest.

IMPORTANT: Don't dupe blatantly, use this with your own risk. I would suggest duping below 50m and not more per day, since it would be really suspicious if that wasn't the case!

Have fun using it!
